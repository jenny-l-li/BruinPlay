# Hackschool Final Project 

## BruinPlay

#### Overview:

BruinPlay is a SoundCloud-like web application that stores songs (MP3 files, song metadata, album artwork, etc.) in a database and presents these songs to a client (user). The client can also listen to any of the songs in the database, and can add or delete songs. 

#### Functionalities:

- Display all currently existing songs, along with their metadata (artist, title, album, album artwork, song length, genre, etc.).
- Add a new song (to server/database) and update website accordingly.
- Delete a song (from server/database) and update website accordingly.
- Play, pause, and seek audio player.
- Show an “Albums” view.

#### What I learned:

- How to independently develop a full-stack web application
- Front-end web development
  - Provide the structure for a dynamic web application using HTML
  - Style it using CSS
  - Use Handlebars.js for DOM manipulation to dynamically update your website
  - Use a JavaScript library to play audio
- Back-end web development
  - Create a server that can accept user input (add/delete songs) using node.js and JSON
